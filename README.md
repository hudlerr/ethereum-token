# Ethereum Token
ðŸ’¸ My HDA token built on the Ethereum platform

### Created a smart contract based on the ERC-20 Standard which implements functions to -
1. Transfer tokens from one address to another
2. Return the total supply of tokens
3. Get the token balance for accounts
4. Approves the 'spender' to withdraw from your account


## Tools Used
* OpenZeppelin - implement contract standards
* Truffle - compile and deploy the token contract to a locally running ethereum network
* Infura and Truffle - deploy the token contract to the Rinkeby Public Test Network
* Metamask - import my token and transfer tokens between accounts
